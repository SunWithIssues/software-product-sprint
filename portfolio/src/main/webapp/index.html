      <!-- Intro: details --> 
      <p>My name is Anya Ellis. I am an undergrad at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). 
          I am majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics. Though I go to school in 
          Chicago, I from the wild and wonderful state of West Virginia. 
      </p>
      <p>West Virginia is actually where I am currently bunkering at during this pandemic. The 
          state has a rich history and lots of trees, mountains, and animals. Sadly, I have 
          allergies to the wildlife here so I stay indoors most of the time playing video games. 
          Though, I know some outdoor basics so... theoretically we could talk about that. 
          However, I might be sneezing. Achoo!
